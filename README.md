# SpaceInvaders2
C# WPF Implementation of arcade classic open source, public domain, some images may be copyright.
## btw
this code was written in the very early learning phases of HNC Computing and the code is... well a bit horrid. This does not represent my current work. 

## Wow.
The legend that is David Olliff Phd of Chichester College found us these fantastic original artworks and we made Space Invaders in C#.net WPF.
Please be aware that this was written in 2010 and that I personally cringe at most of the code but I have included it in my public repos because it was the second program I write for a PC that actually did anything.
Don't s'pose anybody will run it, after all who runs executables these days but still, it was a gas.
