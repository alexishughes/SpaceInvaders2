# SpaceInvaders2
C# WPF Implementation of arcade classic open source, public domain, some images may be copyright.
## btw
this code was written in the very early learning phases of HNC Computing and the code is... well a bit horrid. This does not represent my current work. 

## Wow.
The legend that is David Olliff Phd of Chichester college found us these fantastic original artworks nad we made Space Invaders in VB.net
Please be aware that this was written in 2010 and that I personally cringe at most of the code but I have included it in my public repos because it was the second program I write for a PC that actually did anything.
Don't s'pose anybody will run it, after all who runs executables these days but still, it was a gas.
